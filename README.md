## Download is MALWARE??

Some silly antiviruses do that, I'm not forcing you to trust me, but trust me, this isn't a malware. Some antiviruses do that because the zip's content is unsigned.

### But I still don't trust it.

That's not my problem. shrug

## Installation

The installation is pretty simple, you just extract the .zip into your plugins folder, and it should work.

## Screenshots (soon)
